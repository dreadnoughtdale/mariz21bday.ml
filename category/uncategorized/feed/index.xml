<p>Mariz is a fine and beautiful lady. She looks charming in every possible angle. Her gorgeous smile even makes every picture of her perfect. Those dazzling eyes, fluffy cheeks, rich hair, straight and delicate nose, soft ears, rosy moist lips, and bright exotic skin. To top all of that, it&#8217;s her inner beauty that stands out the most. Her kindness and thoughtfulness. Her generosity and compassion. Her empathy and understanding. Her helpfulness and willingness. Those are the qualities that makes Mariz the best of herself.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m wishing her for more appreciation from the people closest to her. Hopefully she gets the same magnitude of cherishing from the people she cares the most as I give her in this post.</p>
